# Wait, AI is not new

AI with Python has been around for years—machine learning and deep learning have always used Python as a main tool.


So why weren’t we anxious before?

When the whole world talks about Python and AI...

In 2024, Python officially surpassed JavaScript as the most popular language on GitHub.
Jupyter Notebooks usage also surged, highlighting rapid growth in data science and
machine learning on GitHub.

**"As a JS developer, will I be replaced?"**

# Reclaim our position: we are key to AI adoption

Core value of JavaScript/TypeScript developers in the AI era

---

# Generative UI: from templates to tailored interfaces

AI no longer returns plain text; it draws the best interface for each user in real time.

Key ideas

1. Just-in-time rendering: UI is generated on the fly based on intent.
2. Hyper-personalization: the UI adapts to the specific need.
3. Three implementation paths: Static, Declarative, Open-ended HTML.

- Data: AAPL $277.55, +0.24%, trend up

# Mainstream AI agent frameworks

All provide TypeScript support

Regardless of OpenAI, Google, Vercel, or LangChain, mainstream AI agent frameworks
ship solid TypeScript/JavaScript SDKs.

- `npm install openai` - Official OpenAI SDK
- `npm install @google/genai` - Google Generative AI SDK
- `npm install ai` - Vercel AI SDK
- `npm i langchain` - LangChain core
- `npm i @langchain/langgraph` - LangGraph agent framework

# Chrome Built-in AI

::left::

Lightweight AI models built into the browser

Chrome ships Gemini Nano and specialized expert models, offering APIs like Summarizer,
Translator, and Writer. The browser automatically handles model distribution and
management, no developer deployment required. All inference stays local to protect
privacy, and models work offline after download.

**Built-in AI, automatic management, privacy first**

In August 2025, TypeScript surpassed Python and JavaScript to become the most
popular language on GitHub for the first time. Over one million new contributors
were added in a year (+66%), marking the biggest shift in programming languages
in a decade.

**Type safety + AI-assisted development = the future trend**

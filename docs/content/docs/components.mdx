## StaggeredGroup

`StaggeredGroup` applies staggered entrance motion to its direct children.
It is used by several Gemini layouts and can also be used in your own slides.

```md
<StaggeredGroup :base-delay="150" :step="120">

# Headline

A short supporting line.

</StaggeredGroup>
```

### Props

- `initialY` (number, default: `24`) - Initial Y offset in pixels.
- `baseDelay` (number, default: `0`) - Delay before the first item starts.
- `step` (number, default: `150`) - Delay added between items.

## Motion behavior

Gemini uses staggered motion heavily. If you need to sync animations with other
content, group related elements under the same `StaggeredGroup` and adjust the
`baseDelay` to align with surrounding layouts.
